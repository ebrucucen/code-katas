# The Randori Kata Rules

We'll use VS Code Live Share for sharing the keyboard

* Some mechanism for regular switching of the driver and copilot is chosen. We will swap every 10 minutes. One in, one out 
* Two people step up to the keyboard and begin solving the Kata in hand
start from scratch
* use TDD and BabySteps
* remember to switch the pair at the keyboard according to the mechanism chosen
* Everyone present is expected to follow what is going on, and make helpful suggestions. i.e heckle
* The pair at the keyboard should explain what they are doing so everyone can follow.
* The audience should give advice/suggest refactoring on Green . At other times the pair at the keyboard may ask not to be interrupted.
